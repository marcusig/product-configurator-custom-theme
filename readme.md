# Custom theme for the product configurator for WooCommerce

This small plugin enables you to create or override a theme for the configurator. 

## How to use it:

- Download or clone this repo
- In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins > Add new, and upload the archive.
- Change the CSS to fit your project.

Note that the included CSS and SCSS are a copy of the default styles. 
If you wish to use an existing theme to kickstart yours, just copy the files from the original theme, include them in `my-theme` and rename the theme in style.css or style.scss if you wish to use a preprocessor.
